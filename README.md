<h1>COVID-19 Chest X-ray Prediction Model</h1>
<h3>Context</h3>
Corona - COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X -Ray is one of the important imaging methods to identify the corona virus.

With the Chest X - Ray dataset,The Model developed can classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients & this model powers the AI application to test the Corona Virus in Faster Phase.

<h3>Content</h3>
Collection Chest X Ray of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients infected patients along with few other categories such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) ,Streptococcus & ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)

Images name and labels are available in ChestXrayCorona_Metadata.csv

<h3>About the Model</h3>
An accuracy of 95% was obtained with epoch values of 10 with a loss of 0.04
